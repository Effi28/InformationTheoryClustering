# InformationTheoryClustering
This repository includes implementations of multiple clustering algorithms.
I have implemented:
-KNN Clustering which needs k as parameter
-Epsilon-Range Clustering which needs e as parameter
-Informationtheoretical Clustering MDL without parameters
-Informationtheoretical KNN Clustering without parameters

One just has to download the .JAR and use it.

Currently the tool accepts all numerical .arff files.
